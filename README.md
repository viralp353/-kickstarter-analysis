## Challenge
### Outcomes Based on Goals
     To analysis data ,i did plot on 3 factors -successful,failed,canceled,
    what is goal effect on outcomes?
    As per graph we can see that if goal is lees than $1000 then Successful' rate is 75%.![outcome base on goal1].(C:/Users/viral/Desktop/Analysis%20Project/crowdfunding%20Analysis/outcome%20base%20on%20goal1.jpg).
   ### Outcome based on Lunch data
 The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other side, December isn't like a good time to launch a campaign.![kickstart image](C:/Users/viral/Desktop/Analysis%20Project/crowdfunding%20Analysis/kickstart%20image.jpg).
