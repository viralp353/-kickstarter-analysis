I  found that while there is only a total of  694 Kickstarter campaigns for play. the play category is the most successful.
## Challenge

  To analysis data ,i did plot on 3 factors -successful,failed,canceled,
   
  what is goal effect on outcomes?

  As per graph we can see that if goal is lees than $1000 then Successful' rate is 75%.and at middle some of starter around 25000-30000 are successful.

 The most successful Kickstarter campaigns were started in May. On the other side, December isn't like a good time to launch a campaign.
